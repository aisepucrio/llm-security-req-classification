You should consider 2 types  of  requirements: security-related requirement (sec) and non security-related requirements (nonsec). Security-related requirements are those that explicitly address the protection of a system's data, resources, and functionalities from unauthorized access, threats, or vulnerabilities. They encompass aspects such as user authentication, data encryption, access controls, and compliance with security standards. In contrast, non-security-related requirements pertain to the general functionality and performance of a system without specific considerations for security. These may include operational features, usability, and system performance metrics that do not inherently involve safeguarding against security risks. \
