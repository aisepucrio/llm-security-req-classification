Perform RSA private key encryption on the hashed message. This involves padding the hash, encrypting it using the PSAM's private RSA key, and then removing the padding. 3. The resulting ciphertext is the signature. To validate this signature, the CEP card would perform the reverse operation: decrypt the signature with the PSAM's public RSA key, re-hash the original message, and compare the result with the decrypted signature.
