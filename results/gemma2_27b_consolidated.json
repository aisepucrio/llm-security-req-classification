Will there be one centralized system on a European level hosting and providing the mapping or a decentralized system consisting of interconnected national systems? In the latter case, one could define that each national system only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary. A decision to deploy either a centralised or a decentralized infrastructure that provides the mapping service MUST be made. ",

The simplest form without any technical support could for example consist in the one-time distribution of mapping tables in paper-based form. Another solution could consist of a web-based access to a system providing the mapping by querying an underlying database which contains the mapping table. A more advanced solution would be an automated processing of the mapping according to the relevant criteria that therefore have to be specified by the contracting authority in a dedicated electronic format. Also the higher maturity levels defined in this vision (stage 2-4) can use the mapping service in order to retrieve the mapping information.
